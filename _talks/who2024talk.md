I presented results from my PhD on the interdisciplinarity of infectious disease research and the role of research funding in the trend to colleagues from the WHO, NIFU (Norway), and Medical Research Foundation (UK). I noted the rising interdisciplinarity of funded research output and its potential policy implications.

We further discussed the priorities of research funders, and data and quantitative measures for research evaluations. Colleagues from Medical Research Foundation highlighted that practical aspects (like a policy report/change of policy/change of practice/patient benefits/translation into product) are much more important than scholarly impact.
