This study presents a comprehensive analysis to report the amounts and distribution of public and philanthropic global cancer research funding 2016-2023 as well as the patterns of international collaboration in funding and the downstream research outputs, with an emphasis on the Commonwealth.  
 
We demonstrate that annual investment decreased each year globally, apart from a rise 2021. Network analysis revealed that grant and publication collaborations between the Commonwealth, US and Europe is facilitated by linkages through a core of Commonwealth countries around the UK, Australia, and Canada.  
 
There are inequities in research investment and low funding for treatment modalities for many cancers.  The inequities manifest in the central positioning of higher income Commonwealth countries in research collaborations, but also points to opportunities for these countries to facilitate linkages between lower-income countries and active cancer research in the US and Europe.

There is an urgent need to review research investment priorities both in the Commonwealth and globally to align with population needs and promote collaboration strategies that can build research skills and infrastructure in low-income settings to impact global cancer control. Finite resources must be invested wisely to achieve maximum improvements in mortality and alleviate the cancer burden. 
 
This study will be published in The Lancet Oncology in Sep 2025. The core research team has been invited and presented key findings at the Commonwealth Headquarters—alongside the Commonwealth Secretary-General, the Director-General of the WHO, and health ministers from the UK and other Commonwealth nations—forming part of the Commonwealth Lancet Oncology Commission.
