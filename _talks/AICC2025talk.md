The talk shows one of my ongoing work on quantifying the impact of US funding cut. The functional performance of the global science ecosystem, quantified by a network flow measure, has largely relied on the activities originating from the US. If US research and innovation fell by 40%, the EU would need to expand its own activity by 130% to restore overall system performance. The funding cuts from the US create openings for politically aligned groups such as EU, BRICS, and G7 countries to rewire collaborations and build more shock-resilient networks.
