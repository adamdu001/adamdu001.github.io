Interdisciplinary health research involves integrating knowledge and methods from various subjects to tackle complex problems and foster innovation. Prominent funders like the National Institute of Health, the US National Science Foundation and the UKRI all have established their own funding projects for interdisciplinary research. There is a significant body of work in the field of scientometrics on funding allocations; however, up to our best knowledge, there is limited research examining interdisciplinarity, particularly in the context of health funding. Closing this gap will contribute to a better understanding of health research funding and efforts to promote interdisciplinarity.

Our research addresses this gap by representing diseases and their connections as a network, which we use to quantify how interdisciplinary funding allocation has changed over time. For this purpose, we treat a set of 31 infectious diseases as interconnected elements and compare the resulting networks constructed for funded and non-funded research outputs. As we will discuss in the talk, this approach to quantify interdisciplinarity in research allows us to assess whether combinations of disease areas receive funding in proportion to their respective correlation strength as anticipated by the research output: ie if research into particular combinations of diseases is" under-" or" over-funded".
