With the presence of Dr.Sarah Charnaud, I presented the methods and results from my recent publication in The Lancet Oncology. I also presented preliminary results from ongoing work of modelling impact of the US funding cut and the compensation strategies. 

We discussed potential collaborations with the WHO in processing massive grant dataset using AInotate, a data processing platform I co-founded in 2025. We also discussed the potential opportunity to translate the cancer funding map into dashboards at the WHO websites.
