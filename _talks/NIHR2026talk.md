With Prof. WeiShen Lim and other colleagues, I presented preliminary results of ongoing work on mapping 2000-2023 global respiratory funding. I showed that 
(i) Crowding out and research fatigue since 2020 with non-ARI diseases get affected 
(ii) US dominates the funding landscape 2000-2019, with huge funding injection from non-US countries in 2020 
(iii) Inequality between income levels through funding received as PI country and funding received per DALY 
(iv) Core-periphery structure of research leadership, with LMICs at periphery
