Globally, cancer is responsible for one in five deaths. Research is crucial in providing new knowledge for patient care, policy and practice. Our team has conducted a comprehensive analysis to report the amounts and distribution of public and philanthropic global cancer research funding 2016-2023 as well as the patterns of international collaboration in funding and the downstream research outputs, with a specific emphasis on the Commonwealth. This work has been published in The Lancet Oncology.

In March 2025, the team have been invited and presented key findings at the Commonwealth Headquarters—alongside the Commonwealth Secretary-General, the Director-General of the WHO, and health ministers from the UK and other Commonwealth nations—forming part of the Commonwealth Lancet Oncology Commission. 

In addition to those findings reported in the paper, I further highlighted the following points in the talk. Patent invention network related to cancer in the Commonwealth involves less countries and is sparser, compared to clinical trial network and publication network. Pointing out unrealised economic opportunities, we see a potential to strengthen Commonwealth countries’ positioning in the commercialisation of cancer research. This requires improvements on patent filing and innovation ecosystem across the Commonwealth.
