Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Evidence on the landscape of cancer research investment is essential to better allocate available resources equitably and efficiently to optimise health outcomes globally. In this recent study published in The Lancet Oncology, we revealed that in 2017-2023, low-income countries with the highest cancer burden receive disproportionately low cancer research funding. Funding skew to preclinical science compared to clinical trials and public health research. Radiotherapy and surgery were underfunded despite their central role in cancer treatment. Social network analysis of research collaboration revealed the central positioning of high-income countries and the bridging role of certain low-income countries. 

The volatility caused by the recent US funding cuts raises urgent questions about the scale of disruption and feasible mitigation. In ongoing work, we quantify the US-related shock using a network-flow metric and find that restoring system-level performance would require the EU to expand its own activity by approximately 130%. We also establish that these cuts create openings for the EU, BRICS, or other G7 countries to build more shock-resilient global collaboration networks.
