Anbang Du is a PhD researcher in computer science with expertise in big data and complex systems. His work centres on (i) evaluating interdisciplinarity, knowledge spillovers, and collaboration dynamics in the health-science ecosystem; and (ii) applying generative AI to large-scale data processing.

Anbang has published first-author research articles in leading journals such as The Lancet Oncology and Journal of Informetrics. He has also given talks at the 15th Annual Conference on Complex Networks (CompleNet 2024) and at France’s International Conference on Complex Systems (FRCCS 2025). With influence spanning the Commonwealth Secretariat, the WHO, and health ministries around the world, Anbang’s work is shaping policy conversations globally and has been featured by 19 international media outlets.

Anbang is the co-founder of AInotate, an AI-powered platform that makes policy and R&D planning more agile. AInotate has been selected for exhibition as one of 100 projects at Prototypes for Humanity—chosen from 3,300 submissions across more than 100 countries—and he has been invited to showcase the prototype at Jumeirah Emirates Towers in Dubai in November 2025.
