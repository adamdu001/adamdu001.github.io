Anbang Du is a PhD researcher in Computer Science, with strong interests in the intersection of health informatics and complex system. He has a strong quantitative 

Leveraging his skills in big data, his research focuses on developing metrics to inform science and health research policy, including the assessment of interdisciplinarity, spillover, and collaboration dynamics in the ecosystem of (health) science. His research has been published in the Lancet Oncology and the Journal of Informetrics.

He co-led the project on the analysis of global cancer research investment and R&D network for the Lancet Oncology Commission for the Commonwealth. Leveraging advanced machine learning and large language models, he co-developed an automated text classification framework to accurately annotate medical text data. The automated framework saved months of manual effort of text annotation with high precision.

With the knowledge and experience in social network analysis, he also co-developed global collaboration network models for all four stages of cancer research pipeline, i.e., grant applications, publications, patent, and clinical trials. These provide quantitative insights on the relative standing of each country in the four stages of cancer research, effectively informing policymakers on the strengths and weaknesses of the existing research networks.
