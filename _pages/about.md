Anbang Du is a PhD researcher in Computer Science with comprehensive experience in big data and complex systems. His research focuses on evaluating interdisciplinarity, knowledge spillovers, and collaboration dynamics within the health-science ecosystem.

Anbang has published first-author research articles in top tier journals such as The Lancet Oncology and Journal of Informetrics. He has also presented his work at the 15th Annual Conference on Complex Networks (CompleNet 2024) and at France’s International Conference on Complex Systems (FRCCS 2025).

In his role as an affiliated research collaborator at the Harvard University Health System Innovation Lab under Professor Rifat Atun, Anbang co-led the project on the analysis of global cancer research investment and R&D network. In March 2025, he has been invited and presented key findings at the Commonwealth Headquarters—alongside the Commonwealth Secretary-General, the Director-General of the WHO, and health ministers from the UK and other Commonwealth nations—forming part of the Commonwealth Lancet Oncology Commission. He is also contributing further original content to the Lancet Oncology Commission report, due for publication later in 2025. 

Meanwhile, he is also working with Professor WeiShen Lim KBE as well as the NIHR Respiratory-TRC ARI National Research Strategy Group on the analysis of global respiratory research investment.
