Abstract
Background: Globally, cancer is responsible for one in five deaths. Research is crucial in providing new knowledge for patient care, policy and practice. The position of the Commonwealth countries in the global research funding and publication landscape was analysed.
Methods: We combined previously-labelled 2016-2020 data with new searches and analysis of human cancer research funding awarded from public and philanthropic funders 2021-2023, extracted from the Digital Science Dimensions database and Cancer Research UK website. Awards were categorised by cancer type, cross-cutting theme, and research phase. Awards labelling used machine learning algorithms, large language models, and manual scrutiny from cancer experts. Social network analysis examined the position of Commonwealth countries in international collaboration in cancer grant applications and publications.
Findings: We identified 107,955 cancer research awards, with total investment of $51.4 billion USD in 2016-2023. Annual investment decreased each year, apart from a rise in 2021. Pre-clinical research received $39.0 billion (76.0% of funding), phase 1–4 clinical trials receiving $3.7 billion (7.3%). Breast ($5.3 billion, 10.3%) and hematological cancer ($4.7 billion, 9.0%) were well-funded. Surgery research ($0.8 billion, 1.7%) and radiotherapy research ($1.6 billion, 3.1%) were underfunded. In the Commonwealth, the UK, Australia, and Canada were lead contributors and receivers of cancer funding. Low-income countries worldwide received less than 0.1% of total funding. Network analysis revealed close collaborations between a core of high-income Commonwealth countries, that facilitated knowledge exchange between lower-income Commonwealth countries, the US and European Union countries.
Interpretation: Within Commonwealth countries and globally, funding is concentrated in high-income countries. Greater research funding with local leadership should be allocated to lower-income countries that have limited resources to address cancer burden. Investment in cancer research on other treatment modalities, including surgery and radiotherapy, also needs to be prioritised to improve patient benefits.
